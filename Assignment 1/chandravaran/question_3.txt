There are many unique things that can be done with data frames in python, one the few things that i was able to see
while working on these data sets is that it is vry easy to resize the data that is given an manipulate it very easily 
but unique feture that i found while working on this is that there is a function called 'groupby' so when we use this 
function to a certain column it takes the unique elements of this column and that makes the groups for these of all the
other columns so if we wanted to find the number of times a certain person or thing has done in the whole data set we
can easily use this and if the data set is of type int than it would and give the values.
